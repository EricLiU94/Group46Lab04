# A General Description of the Linear Regression Package
<p> This linear regression package is designed to estimate the linear regression coefficients, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ numerically, by using the classic algebraic methods. Two input variables are required, \textbf{data}, contains the intended data set; \textbf{formula}, which defines the included dependent and indepedent variables. All the estimated coefficients, including the linear regression coefficients, the estimated residuals, its variance, the degree of freedom, the t value and the p value, are accessible for the user by typing a few simple commands. 
</p> 
#  Two Informative Examples
<p> Two datasets have been employed to demonstrate how to use this package, \textbf{Iris} and \textbf{faithful}.

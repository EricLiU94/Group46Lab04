# A General Description of the Linear Regression Package
This linear regression package is designed to estimate the linear regression coefficients, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ numerically, by using the classic algebraic methods. Two input variables are required, \textbf{data}, contains the intended data set; \textbf{formula}, which defines the included dependent and indepedent variables. All the estimated coefficients, including the linear regression coefficients, the estimated residuals, its variance, the degree of freedom, the t value and the p value, are accessible for the user by typing a few simple commands. 
 
#  Two Informative Examples
Two datasets have been employed to demonstrate how to use this package, __Iris__ and __faithful__.

## One dependent Variable and One Independent Variable 
The dataset __faithful__ contains two columns, *the eruptions* and *the waiting*. When attempting to extracting a slope, which describes how the magnutide of eruption alters with the change of waiting, for input variable formula would be 

formula<- waiting~eruption

data <- faithful

The computations would be initialised by typing down the following commands 

x<-linreg(formula= waiting~eruption, data=faithful )
